   ## Description
   This product utilises the jQuery method ajax to use a weather API that describes the weather of any city in the world. By grabbing the key information and displaying it to the webpage, users are able to find the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index for the current day as well as temperature, whether it is snowing, raning, clear or cloudy and the humidity for the following five days.
